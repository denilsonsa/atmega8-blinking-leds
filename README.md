This project aims to be a simple "Hello World" for working with AVR
microcontrollers. It has been written for [ATmega8][atmega8], but should be
fairly easy to port for other microcontrollers from the [AVR family][avr].

Quick description of the files:

* `c-with-gcc/`: Source-code written in C for compiling with GCC.
* `asm-with-gcc/`: Source-code written in assembly for compiling with GCC.
* `asm-with-tavrasm/`: Source-code written in assembly for compiling with [tavrasm][tavrasm], [AVRA][avra], or Atmel's assembler.
* `atmega8-blinking-leds*`: Circuit schematic diagram (drawn in [Inkscape][inkscape]).
* `Makefile.tpl`: Template Makefile from [Psychogenic Inc][makefile].
